# Quick Reference

Short examples for common use cases.

## Minimal Program

```mettle
fn main() -> int32 {
  return 0;
}
```

## With Imports

```mettle
import "std/io";

fn main() -> int32 {
  println("Hello, Mettle!");
  return 0;
}
```

See [Imports](imports.md) for path resolution and `import_str`.

## With Prelude

```mettle
// Compile with: mettle --prelude main.mettle -o main.s
fn main() -> int32 {
  println("Hello");
  return 0;
}
```

## With Extern

```mettle
extern fn puts(msg: cstring) -> int32 = "puts";

fn main() -> int32 {
  puts("Hello");
  return 0;
}
```

## With Enum and Switch

```mettle
enum Status { Ok = 0, Error = 1 }

fn main() -> int32 {
  var s: Status = Ok;
  switch (s) {
    case 0:
      return 0;
    default:
      return 1;
  }
}
```

## With Explicit Casts

```mettle
fn main() -> int32 {
  var f: float64 = 3.14;
  var i: int32 = (int32)f;
  
  var p: int32* = (int32*)0;
  var address: int64 = (int64)p;
  
  return i;
}
```

## With Heap Allocation and Structs

Uses `new` for zero-initialized heap allocation. The emitted code calls `calloc(1, n)` directly; no Mettle runtime object is linked unless the program also uses `-d`/`-s` crash tracebacks or `std/thread` atomics. See [Heap Allocator Runtime](heap-allocation.md).

```mettle
struct Point {
  x: int32;
  y: int32;
}

fn main() -> int32 {
  var p: Point* = new Point;
  p->x = 10;
  p->y = 20;
  return p->x + p->y;
}
```

## Range-based for and `@simd`

```mettle
fn dot(a: int8*, b: int8*, n: int32) -> int32 {
  var s: int32 = 0;
  @simd! for i in 0..n {              // 0..n exclusive; 0..=n inclusive
    s = s + (int32)a[i] * (int32)b[i];
  }
  return s;                           // @simd! = compile error if it can't vectorize
}
```

`@simd` is a best-effort hint (warns if not vectorized); `@simd!` is a hard
contract. Both are checked under `-O`/`--release`; add `--simd-report` to see
what each loop became. See [Control Flow](control-flow.md#vectorization-contracts).

To see what the optimizer decided about **every** loop and call in your file —
no annotations needed — compile with `--explain` (`-O`/`--release`):

```
saxpy (loop @ line 12): vectorized → vfmadd231ps, 8-wide float32 affine map
matvec (loop @ line 38): NOT vectorized
    └ reason: this is a float multiply-accumulate (dot-product shape), but no
      kernel matched its address pattern
    └ fix: hoist invariant index math into a pointer before the loop
main (call to `opaque` @ line 74): NOT inlined
    └ reason: the callee is marked @noinline
```

Nests are summarized (`vectorized inner, scalar outer`), fully unrolled loops
say so, and a backend section reports register-allocation coverage weighted by
instructions — with the fallbacks grouped by cause, largest functions first,
and a `consequence:`/`fix:` line per cause (e.g. a function containing a SIMD
kernel still runs the kernel at full vector speed; only its scalar code
spills):

```
  1742/1850 functions reaching codegen compiled with the register-allocating backend
  97.2% of the program's 215,012 optimized IR instructions are in register-allocated code

  contains a call form the register allocator doesn't support yet (39 functions, 8,120 instructions):
      └ consequence: every value in the function is kept on the stack instead of in registers
      └ largest: editor_tick (1480), vk_scene_build (912) ...
```

Reports past ~200 lines (real applications) are written to
`<output-stem>.explain.txt` next to the output binary, with a five-line digest
on stderr (`METTLE_EXPLAIN_REPORT_LINES` overrides the threshold; `0` never
diverts).

Fix suggestions are **verified, not guessed**, where the compiler can prove
them: it applies the suggested change to an internal clone, re-runs its own
optimizer on it, and only then prints a `verified:` line —

```
sum_bytes (loop @ line 27): NOT vectorized
    └ reason: this is a byte-sum loop, but the vpsadbw kernel accumulates
      into int64 and this loop's accumulator is narrower
    └ fix: declare the accumulator as int64
    └ verified: simulated that fix and re-ran the optimizer: this loop
      then vectorizes → vpsadbw, 32-wide byte sum (AVX2)
```

The same applies to inlining advice: "mark it @inline" is re-checked with the
decorator pretend-applied, and when a hidden structural guard means it would
NOT help, the report says that instead of giving advice that won't work.

The verified library covers element-width fixes (int16/int64 → int32),
accumulator widening (int32 and byte sums need an int64 accumulator), the
dot-product row-pointer hoist, and call-in-the-loop fixes — for those the
compiler pretend-applies the decorator change, re-runs its own **inliner** on
a clone of the caller, and proves lines like `simulated removing @noinline
from damp ... this loop then vectorizes → vfmadd231ps`. And when a simulation
proves the standard advice is *unwritable* (e.g. the index math genuinely
changes every iteration — a real non-unit-stride access), the advice is
replaced with that finding rather than printed.

## Function decorators

```mettle
@inline   fn f(x: int32) -> int32 { return x * 3; }   // force inline
@inline!  fn l(a: float32, b: float32) -> float32 {   // CONTRACT: every call
  return a + b;                                             // inlines, or compile error
}
@noinline fn g() -> int32 { return 1; }               // never inline
@pure @noinline fn w(t: int32*, k: int32) -> int32 { /* ... */ }
@noalloc  fn hot(x: float32) -> float32 {             // CONTRACT: proven
  return x * x;                                             // allocation-free
}
@simd!    fn s(a: int32*, n: int64) -> int64 { /* every body loop must vectorize */ }
```

Prefix a function with `@inline`/`@noinline` (inlining control), `@pure`
(side-effect-free → loop-invariant calls hoisted out of loops), or
`@simd`/`@simd!` (vectorization contract on every body loop). Decorators stack,
take effect under `-O`/`--release`, and apply to functions only. See
[Declarations](declarations.md#function-decorators).

The `!` decorators are **contracts**: the compiler either delivers the
optimization or fails the build with the precise reason. `@inline!` errors on
any call site that survives inlining (e.g. recursion, the caller's growth
budget). `@noalloc` proves the function — and everything it can reach through
direct calls — performs zero heap allocations: `new`, string `+`, allocator
calls, unprovable externs, and function-pointer calls inside the reachable
graph are all compile errors pointing at the offending site. Verified
`@noalloc` functions are reported in `--explain`.

## GPU kernel and dispatch

```mettle
// kernels.mettle  ->  mettle --emit-ptx kernels.mettle -o kernels.ptx
kernel vadd(a: float32*, b: float32*, c: float32*, n: int32) {
  workgroup var tile: float32[256];
  private var scratch: int32[4];
  var i: int32 = block.x * block_dim.x + thread.x;
  if (thread.x < 256 && i < n) { tile[thread.x] = a[i] + b[i]; }
  barrier(workgroup, acq_rel);
  if (thread.x < 256 && i < n) { c[i] = tile[thread.x]; }
}
```

```mettle
// host.mettle  ->  mettle --build host.mettle -o host --link-arg .../cuda.lib
import "std/gpu";
// ... gpu_init, gpu_module, gpu_func, gpu_malloc, gpu_to_device ...
dispatch vadd[(n + 255) / 256, 256](da, db, dc, n);

dispatch gemm[grid: (tiles_n, tiles_m, batch),
              block: (32, 1, 1),
              shared: arena_bytes,
              stream: compute_stream](a, b, c, d, m, n, k);
```

Here `vadd` is the runtime function handle returned by `gpu_func`, not a
compile-time reference to the source kernel declaration. `dispatch` preserves
a typed, target-neutral launch in IR; the host backend alone marshals it for
the selected runtime provider. The compact form supplies 1-D grid/block sizes.
The named form requires `grid: (x,y,z)` and `block: (x,y,z)` and optionally
accepts `shared:` dynamic-arena bytes plus `stream:`; controls may be reordered.
libmtlc's `mtlc_gpu_launch` builds the identical operation.

`workgroup var name: T[N]` is fixed storage shared by a workgroup;
`private var name: T[N]` is fixed storage per work-item. A pointer-shaped
`workgroup var arena: T*` is an unbounded view of launch-sized workgroup memory;
multiple typed views alias one base and are partitioned with aligned offsets.
All are kernel-only. `barrier(workgroup, global,
acq_rel)` accepts one or both memory regions and an acquire/release/acq-rel/
seq-cst order; all live work-items must reach it uniformly.

Native subgroup built-ins expose `subgroup_local_id`, `subgroup_size`, typed
`subgroup_broadcast(value, lane)`, add/min/max reductions, and inclusive or
exclusive add scans for u32/f32, variable-source `subgroup_shuffle`,
word-addressed `subgroup_ballot`, and boolean `subgroup_any` / `subgroup_all`.
No declaration is required. Collectives must be uniform, and a broadcast source
lane must be uniform and valid. PTX uses a 32-lane warp; SPIR-V keeps the
implementation-defined OpenCL subgroup size and uses KHR ballot/vote extensions.

Native atomic built-ins are type-directed for `uint32*`, `uint64*`, and matching
workgroup arrays. Loads and value-returning operations need no extern; stores
return `void`:

```mettle
var ticket: uint32 = atomic_fetch_add(counter, index, 1,
                                      order: acq_rel, scope: device);
var ready: uint32 = atomic_load(flags, index,
                                order: acquire, scope: device);
atomic_store(flags, index, 1, order: release, scope: device);
var observed: uint64 = atomic_compare_exchange(
    state, index, expected, desired,
    success_order: seq_cst, failure_order: acquire, scope: system);
```

The full family is `atomic_load`, `atomic_store`,
`atomic_fetch_add/sub/min/max/and/or/xor`, `atomic_exchange`, and
`atomic_compare_exchange`. Storage is inferred as global or workgroup;
`space:` may state it explicitly. Defaults are seq-cst and device scope for
global storage or workgroup scope for workgroup storage. Loads accept
relaxed/acquire/seq-cst; stores accept relaxed/release/seq-cst. CAS failure
order is distinct and cannot be release/acq-rel or stronger than success.

Native cooperative tensor operations use named, compile-time semantics rather
than backend fragments or opcodes:

```mettle
kernel tile(a: uint16*, b: uint16*, c: float32*, d: float32*) {
  tensor_mma(a, b, c, d,
             shape: m16n16k16,
             input_type: f16, output_type: f32,
             a_layout: row, b_layout: col);
}

kernel gemm_region(a: uint16*, b: uint16*, c: float32*, d: float32*,
                   m: uint32, n: uint32, k: uint32,
                   lda: uint32, ldb: uint32, ldc: uint32, ldd: uint32) {
  tensor_matmul(a, b, c, d,
                (uint32)block.y * (uint32)16,
                (uint32)block.x * (uint32)16,
                m, n, k,
                shape: m16n16k16,
                input_type: f16, output_type: f32,
                lda: lda, ldb: ldb, ldc: ldc, ldd: ldd);
}

kernel finish(d: float32*, bias: float32*, alpha: float32, beta: float32) {
  tensor_epilogue(d, shape: m32n16, element_type: f32,
                  bias_mode: column, bias: bias,
                  alpha: alpha, beta: beta, activation: relu);
}
```

`shape` can be replaced by `m`/`n`/`k`; independent operand/result formats,
all four layouts/leading dimensions, transpose, rounding, overflow, math,
sparsity, scale operands, and subgroup/workgroup scope are represented. Leading
dimensions may be compile-time integers or uniform runtime integer expressions.
`tensor_matmul(A,B,C,D,row,column,M,N,K,...)` computes one exact bounded
whole-matrix region. Its five controls are unsigned and uniform; all four
whole-matrix leading dimensions are explicit. PTX keeps full runtime-K chunks
resident when legal and cooperatively computes every M/N/K edge. PTX can view
independently transposed A/B through the opposite backend-local layout; forced
fallback still replays transpose exactly, and neither path creates a frontend
transpose. Unscaled E4M3/E5M2 inputs have exact architectural conversion and
cooperative edge replay plus resident direct-MMA full interiors. Matched
block32/UE8M0 FP8/FP6/FP4 descriptors and packed block32/UE8M0 or
block16/UE4M3 E2M1 descriptors likewise keep scaled native interiors resident
and replay every M/N/K edge exactly. `scale_A` is logical row-major
`[M,ceil(K/block)]`; `scale_B` is logical column-major
`[ceil(K/block),N]`, independently of operand transpose. Dense FP6/FP4 is an
LSB-first logical bitstream. Matching f16/bf16 structured-2:4 regions use two
stored A values and one uint8 mask per logical four-wide K group. Metadata is
compact row-major `[M,ceil(K/4)]`, does not transpose with A, and a partial final
group still owns two stored values; PTX keeps complete K16 `mma.sp` chunks
resident and replays every edge from the neutral masks. Unsupported numeric or
sparse tail families reject rather than round, pad, or silently narrow.
`tensor_epilogue` is a separate exact `activation(alpha*D + beta*bias)`
collective with row/column D layout, absent/row/column/matrix bias,
identity/ReLU/clamp, f16/bf16/f32/f64 storage, and subgroup/workgroup scope.
ReLU and clamp use ordered comparisons and preserve unordered values.
PTX always has ordered cooperative memory replay and may consume an adjacent
compatible MMA/commit directly. It may also carry a verified loop accumulator
across its exit jump when that jump is the epilogue label's only predecessor;
bypass edges force replay. Stable opaque WMMA permits bias-free scalar post-ops;
direct mapped MMA permits every bias mode. No fragment enters shared IR.

The PTX backend supports the stable WMMA family and rejects unsupported profiles;
the current OpenCL 2.0 SPIR-V profile explicitly rejects unsupported tensor
MMA and epilogue capabilities.

## With Generics

Generic functions and structs with compile-time monomorphization. See [Declarations](declarations.md#generic-functions) and [Types](types.md#generic-type-parameters).

```mettle
struct Pair<A, B> {
  first: A;
  second: B;
}

function swap<T>(a: T*, b: T*) -> void {
  var tmp: T = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = tmp;
}

fn main() -> int32 {
  var p: Pair<int32, int32>;
  p.first = 10;
  p.second = 20;
  swap<int32>(&p.first, &p.second);
  return p.first + p.second;
}
```
