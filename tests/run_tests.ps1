# binary modules (--emit-spirv, the OpenCL 1.2 sibling of --emit-ptx) and

# consistent word-count walk that lands exactly on EOF, an in-range id bound,
# and every OpEntryPoint referencing a defined OpFunction. When the Vulkan SDK's
# spirv-val is on PATH it is run too (the authoritative full validation, like
# ptxas for PTX); otherwise the structural check stands alone (skip-augmented,
# never skipped -- the emitter must always produce a well-formed module).
