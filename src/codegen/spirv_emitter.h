/* Lower an IR program to a SPIR-V binary module (one OpEntryPoint per function,
 * execution model Kernel), targeting the OpenCL 1.2 execution environment:
 * Physical64 addressing, the Kernel capability, and the OpenCL memory model.
 * This is the flavor that fits Mettle's GPU kernel ABI -- kernels take raw
 * typed pointers as parameters and perform pointer arithmetic + loads/stores
 * plus the gpu_* index intrinsics, i.e. the CUDA/OpenCL model. (Vulkan/Logical
 * SPIR-V would force a descriptor-buffer redesign of the kernel model.)
 *
 * The emitter is the SPIR-V sibling of ptx_emitter.c and covers the same IR
 * subset: scalar/pointer parameters, locals, load/store, binary/unary/cast, the
 * gpu_tid_/ntid_/ctaid_/nctaid_ index intrinsics, gpu_barrier(), the f32 math
 * intrinsics, h2f/f2h fp16 conversion, and the unsigned atomics.
 *
 * Control flow maps directly onto SPIR-V blocks (OpBranch /
 * OpBranchConditional), exactly like PTX `bra`: SPIR-V's structured-control-flow
 * rules are mandated only by the Shader capability, and Kernel (OpenCL) modules
 * may branch freely (spirv-val --target-env opencl1.2 confirms). Values that
 * cross basic blocks live in Function-storage variables (reg2mem); a driver's
 * SPIR-V consumer promotes them back to registers.
 *
 * Returns 1 on success. On failure returns 0 and, if error is non-NULL, sets
 * *error to a malloc'd message the caller must free. */
